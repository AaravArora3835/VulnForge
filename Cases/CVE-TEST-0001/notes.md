# **CVE-TEST-0001 — SQL Injection Login Bypass**

## Summary

This case demonstrates a basic SQL injection login bypass in a controlled training environment. The objective is to show how unsanitized user input can be used to manipulate SQL queries and gain unauthorized access. This test CVE builds foundational skills for analyzing and reproducing real-world SQL injection attacks. The exercise highlights how weak authentication logic can allow an attacker to inject SQL fragments into login fields to enumerate or bypass user authentication.

## CVSS & Metadata

* **CVSS:** 9.8 (Critical) — mirrors real-world SQL injection severity
* **CWE:** CWE-89 — Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command
* **Vendor:** Practice environment (DVWA)
* **Disclosure Date:** Not applicable (training case)

---

## Lab Environment

* Kali Linux virtual machine running in VirtualBox
* DVWA hosted locally using Apache2 and MariaDB
* Browser: Firefox inside Kali
* DVWA security level: **Low**
* Database manually initialized using DVWA’s *Create / Reset Database* function

---

## Exploitation Steps

1. Opened DVWA at `http://127.0.0.1/dvwa` and logged in as `admin` / `password`.
2. Confirmed DVWA database initialization via the *Create / Reset Database* option.
3. Set the DVWA security level to **Low** to disable input sanitation.
4. Navigated to the **SQL Injection** module.
5. Entered the payload `' OR '1'='1` in the User ID field and submitted the request.
6. DVWA returned multiple user records instead of one, confirming direct concatenation of user input into SQL statements.
7. Recorded evidence in the screenshot `2025-12-06_SQLi_FirstAttempt.png`.

### Basic SQLi Payloads Tested

* `' OR '1'='1`
* `' OR ''=''`
* `' OR 1=1--`

---

## Impact

A successful login bypass allows an attacker to:

* Access sensitive user information
* Impersonate any account without valid credentials
* Potentially escalate privileges depending on application structure
* Extract full database contents if additional injection points exist

In real applications, this could lead to full database compromise.

---

## Mitigations

* Use parameterized queries / prepared statements
* Implement strict input validation (allowlist patterns)
* Apply least-privilege permissions on database users
* Use proper error handling to avoid exposing SQL messages
* Enable Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for query anomaly detection

---

## Defender Playbook

* Monitor for repeated failed login attempts followed by unusual success patterns
* Detect `' OR` patterns in authentication logs
* Alert on full-table selects triggered from login endpoints
* Review database logs for abnormal query behavior
* Perform regular vulnerability scanning on input fields
